# Effortless Population of Grids and Charts from Pivot Field List: A Step-by-Step Guide

This project demonstrates how to render grid and chart components using a server-side pivot field list component.

The following steps demonstrate how to run the application,

* Open the [PivotController](./PivotController/) application in Visual Studio.
* Dependent packages will be downloaded automatically from the nuget.org site.
* Run the application once the packages are downloaded.
* Once the application is hosted in the localhost, copy and paste its URL in the **Sample->pivot.js** file.
* Then open the **Sample->pivot.html** file. The pivot field list will be populated in the browser with data grid and chart.
