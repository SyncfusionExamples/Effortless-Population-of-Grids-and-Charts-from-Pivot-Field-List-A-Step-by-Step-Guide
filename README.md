# How to render a Pivot Field List using a Server-side Engine

This project explains how to render the pivot field list in the JavaScript Pivot Table component using a server-side engine, as well as how to combine other data visualization components such as data grid and chart components based on the field list report information.

The following steps demonstrate how to run the application,

* Open the [PivotController](./PivotController/) application in Visual Studio.
* Dependent packages will be downloaded automatically from the nuget.org site.
* Run the application once the packages are downloaded.
* Once the application is hosted in the localhost, copy and paste its URL in the **Sample->pivot.js** file.
* Then open the **Sample->pivot.html** file. The pivot field list will be populated in the browser with data grid and chart.
